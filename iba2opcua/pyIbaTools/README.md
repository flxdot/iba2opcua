# pyIbaTools

A package containing often used python functions when analyzing ibaFiles

## Getting Started

Currently available functions:

* `getFiles(directory, file_type="", scan_sub_folders=True, verbose=False)`<br />
   Find all file of a specific type within a folder and its sub folders.
* `ibaReader(iba_file)`<br />
   Context manager which yields a ibaFilesLite.FileReader() which opened the wanted iba_file
* `ibaChannelReader(channel_, freader_)`<br />
   A context manager to read a iba channel from a file
* `getSortedIbaFiles(directory, scan_sub_folders=True, verbose=False)`<br />
   Find iba files within a given directory and sort the files by start time in ascending order
* `readIbaFile(iba_file, channels=None, names=None, tbase=0, delimiter=',', caching=True)`<br />
   Read the wanted channel from a iba_file with a specified tbase.
   The Caching is especially useful when reading data from a network drive.
* `get_channels(iba_file)`<br />
   Use this method to get a list of all available channels in the given file
* `get_channel_info(iba_file, channels=None)`<br />
   Use to get information about each channel.
* `checkFile(iba_file)`<br />
   Use this method to check if a iba file is valid and to retrieve some basic
   information like the sample rate and number of frames.
* `is_channel(chan, file)`<br />
   Use to check the existing of a certain channel in a given iba file.
